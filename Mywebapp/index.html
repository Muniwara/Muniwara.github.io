                  Humans have shaped the environment they have lived in for as long as they have existed on Earth.

                  If there were no restrictions, it is believed that women can give birth to 15 living children on
                  average

                  which explains the trend in population growth at this present time. It is important to know where the
                  world has reached in terms of population, identify countries that account for the most population in

                  the world, and identify the factors that cause either an increase or decrease in the population of a

                  particular countries arounnd the world. This webmap visually displays the 2023 population data by the

                  means of a choropleth map to show the distribution of the world population among countries.

        <h1>How map works</h1>

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>This map is made up of different shades of blue and each shade tends to show the extent of a country's
            population.</li>
          <li>The countries with the deepest shade of blue signifies countries with the highest population and countries
            with the
            lowest population.</li>
          <!-- <li>Hovering your mouse over each country would display the name, fertility rate, and urban population. </li> -->
