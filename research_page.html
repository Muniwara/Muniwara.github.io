    <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
    <p>I am an aspiring geographic information science (GIS) engineer who wants to uses 
      GIS techniques and big data to solve real-world problems, especially in the field of 
      environmental management to help improve the quality of life for humans. To achieve 
      this goal, I am currently seeking a master's degree in geography with a concentration in 
      GIS. <br>
      Some research I have done in this area are :
      <ul>
        <li> The application of Normalized Build-up index in estimating the spatial and temporal expansion of the Ga East Municipal Area(GEMA) <br>
          Here I used Remote sensing techniques and Software to analyze the changes that has occured in the GEMA area over a 20 year span.
      </ul>
